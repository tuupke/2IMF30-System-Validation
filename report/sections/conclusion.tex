In this report we have showed that a model for an ASML UEV Waferstepper can be derived, for which requirements can be created in natural language, derived to - amongst others - model $\mu$-calculus and verified. Using the verification we can now be (more) sure that code written for this specific machine will function in a correct manner and not present undesirable behaviour. Thus making sure that the machine functions correct and to the expectations of the customer and furthermore not costing our company (in this case ASML) more money with regards to fixing errors introduced when the verification would not have taken place.
