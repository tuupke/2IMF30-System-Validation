This section clarifies the textual requirements proposed in section 3.3 by defining them more accurately in terms of the actions described in section 4. These definitions serve as a bridge between the intuitive textual description and the logical formulas in section 6 that can be mathematically tested against the model of the wafer stepper controller. \cbend

\begin{description}
 \item[1. At least one door of a sluice is closed at any point in time] \hfill \\
 For any sluice $s$:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Between any \action{openDoor}{inside, $s$} and its most recent preceding \action{openDoor}{outside, $s$}, there must be a \action{closeDoor}{outside, $s$}
  \item Between any \action{openDoor}{outside, $s$} and its most recent preceding \action{openDoor}{inside, $s$}, there may not be a \action{closeDoor}{inside, $s$}
 \end{itemize}

 \item[2. No robot may interact with a sluice whenever its access door is closed] \hfill \\
For any sluice $s$:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Between any \action{move}{$RI, s$} and its most recent preceding \action{closeDoor}{outside,$s$}, there must be an \action{openDoor}{outside, $s$}.
	\item between any \action{move}{$s, a$} with $a \in \{ I, O \}$ and its most recent preceding \action{closeDoor}{inside, $s$}, there must be an \action{openDoor}{inside, $s$}.
	\item between any \action{move}{$a, s$} with $a \in \{ I, O \}$ and its most recent preceding \action{closeDoor}{inside, $s$}, there must be an \action{openDoor}{inside, $s$}.
	\item between any \action{move}{$s, a$} with $a \in \{ RI, RO \}$ and its most recent preceding \action{closeDoor}{outside, $s$}, there must be an \action{openDoor}{outside, $s$}.
\end{itemize}
 
 \cbstart
 \item[\smash{\shortstack[l]{3. Any wafer in the system will eventually be processed unless for each sluice at \\ least one door gets stuck, or the wafer is in a sluice with two broken, closed doors}}] \hfill 
 
 Define a ``chain'' of move actions to be a list of actions $L$  in which a set of $n$ move actions $M$ is contained. For $1 \leq i \leq n$, the destination of move $M_{i-1}$ equals the origin of move $M_{i}$ and the there is no move action between these two actions in $L$ with the same origin as $M_{i}$.
 
For Sluice s, Door d, define a $brokenDoorEvent(s,d)$  to be a list of actions $L$ where between a \action{doorStuck}{d,s} and its most recent preceding \action{closeDoor}{d, s} there is no \action{openDoor}{d, s}.
 
 After any \action{detectInputWafer}{}, there must be a chain of move actions $C1$ connecting $RI$ to $P$, followed by a \action{beginProject}{} and \action{endProject}{} without intervening move actions with $P$, followed by a chain of move actions $C2$ from $P$ to $RO$.
 
 Unless either:
 \begin{itemize}
 \item For any Door $d_1$,$d_2$: \action{doorStuck}{$d_1$, Sluice1} and \action{doorStuck}{$d_2$, Sluice2} both happen before the end of $C2$
 
 \item For any Sluice s, Door $d_1,d_2$, Place $p_1,p_2$: a $brokenDoorEvent(s,d_1)$ , $brokenDoorEvent(s,d_2)$ and  \action{move}{$p_1$, s} precede a \action{move}{s, $p_2$} 
 \end{itemize}
 \cbend
 
\item[4. Internal racks, sluices and the projector each contain at most one wafer] \hfill \\
For any internal place $p_i \in \{S1, S2, I, O, P\}$ and any of the three places $p_1, p_2, p_3 \in \{S1, S2, I, O, P, RI, RO\}$: between any \action{move}{$p_1, p_i$} and its most recent preceding \action{move}{$p_2, p_i$}, there must be a \action{move}{$p_i, p_3$}. 
 
\item[5. When the projector is at work, no interaction with the wafer is permissible] \hfill \\
For any place $p$: between any \action{move}{$P, p$} or \action{move}{$p, P$} and its most recent preceding \action{beginProject}{}, there must be an \action{endProject}{}. 
 
 \item[6. A sluice door cannot open until the pressure on both sides is equal] \hfill \\
 \cbstart For any sluice $s$:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item There exists a most recent \action{readAirPressure}{s, p} before any \action{openDoor}{insideDoor, s} where $p = \texttt{vacuum}$
  \item The most recent \action{readAirPressure}{s, p'} before any \action{openDoor}{outsideDoor, s} must have $p' = \texttt{normal}$

 \end{itemize}
 \cbend

 \item[7. Sluice pumps cannot operate until both of its doors are closed] \hfill \\
 For any sluice $s$:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Between any \action{Vacuum}{$s$} or \action{deVacuum}{$s$} and its most recent preceding \action{openDoor}{inside, $s$}, there must be a \action{closeDoor}{inside, $s$}
  \item Between any \action{Vacuum}{$s$} or \action{deVacuum}{$s$} and its most recent preceding \action{openDoor}{outside, $s$}, there must be a \action{closeDoor}{outside, $s$}
 \end{itemize}

\item[8. No robot can place a projected wafer in $RI$] \hfill \\
For any place $a$ in the system: a \action{move}{$a, RI$} may only be executed when $position(a) = \texttt{unprojected}$.

\item[9. No robot can place an unprojected wafer in $RO$] \hfill \\
For any place $a$ in the system: a \action{move}{$a, RO$} may only be executed when $position(a) = \texttt{projected}$.

\item[10. No robot can take a wafer from $RO$] \hfill \\
\action{move}{$RO, a$} cannot take place for any $a$.
