 \item[Any wafer in the system will eventually be processed] \hfill \\
 
 \item[Internal racks, sluices and the projector each contain at most one wafer] \hfill \\
 For any internal place $p_i \in \{S1, S2, I, O, P\}$ and any three places $p_1, p_2, p_3 \in \{S1, S2, I, O, P, RI, RO\}$: between any \action{move}{$p_1, p_i$} and its most recent preceding \action{move}{$p_2, p_i$}, there must be a \action{move}{$p_i, p_3$}.
 
 \item[When the projector is at work, no interaction with the wafer is permissible] \hfill \\
 For any place $p$: between any \action{move}{$P, p$} or \action{move}{$p, P$} and its most recent preceding \action{beginProject}{}, there must be a \action{endProject}{}.
 
 \item[A sluice door cannot open until the pressure on both sides is equal] \hfill \\
