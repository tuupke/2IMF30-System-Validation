 For any sluice $s$:
 \begin{itemize}

  \item Between any \action{openOutside}{$s$} and its most recent preceding \action{openInside}{$s$}, there may not be a \action{closeInside}{$s$}
 \end{itemize}

 \item[2. No robot may interact with a sluice whenever its access door is closed] \hfill \\
For any sluice $s$:

\begin{itemize}

 \item[3. Any wafer in the system will eventually be processed] \hfill \\
 \begin{itemize}
 \item There must be at least one \action{detectWafer}{$RI, s$} for some status $s$.
 \item After any \action{detectWafer}{$RI, s$} for some status $s$ there must be at least one \action{detectWafer}{$RI, t$} for some status $t$.
 \item After any \action{detectWafer}{$RI, \text{unprojected}$} there must be a \action{move}{$RI, a$} for some place $a$ in the system.
 \item After any \action{move}{$RI, a$} for some place $a$ in the system, there must a \action{move}{$b, RO$} for some place $b$ in the system.
 \end{itemize}
 
 
\item[4. Internal racks, sluices and the projector each contain at most one wafer] \hfill \\
For any internal place $p_i \in \{S1, S2, I, O, P\}$ and any three places $p_1, p_2, p_3 \in \{S1, S2, I, O, P, RI, RO\}$: between any \action{move}{$p_1, p_i$} and its most recent preceding \action{move}{$p_2, p_i$}, there must be a \action{move}{$p_i, p_3$}. 
 
\item[5. When the projector is at work, no interaction with the wafer is permissible] \hfill \\
For any place $p$: between any \action{move}{$P, p$} or \action{move}{$p, P$} and its most recent preceding \action{beginProject}{}, there must be a \action{endProject}{}.

\item[8. No robot can place a projected wafer in $RI$] \hfill \\
For any place $a$ in the system: before any \action{move}{$a, RI$}, a \action{detectWafer}{$a, \text{unprojected}$} must have been executed and in between, no \action{move}{$a, b$} has been executed for any $b$.
