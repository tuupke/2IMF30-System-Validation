\begin{itemize}
  \item At least one door of a sluice is closed at any point in time.
  \item No robot may interact with a sluice whenever its access door is closed.
  \item An unprocessed wafer will eventually be processed.
  \item Internal racks, sluices, and the projector place each contain at most one wafer.
  \item When the projector is at work, no interaction with the wafer is permissible.
  \item \todo{Sluice pumps change the air pressure to either zero or one atmosphere. (controversy)}
  \item A sluice door cannot open until the pressure on both sides is equal.
  \item Sluice pumps will not operate until both of its doors are closed.
  \item \emph{R3} will not take a wafer from \emph{I} when \emph{P} is occupied.
  \item \emph{R3} will not put wafers in \emph{I}.
  \item \emph{R3} will not take wafers from \emph{O}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item A wafer is considered processed when the projector has finished processing and the wafer has exited the stepper.
  \item The doors are the only part of the machines that can malfunction.
  \item The main room is assumed to always be a vacuum.
  \item The external input and output racks are assumed to be infinite in size.
