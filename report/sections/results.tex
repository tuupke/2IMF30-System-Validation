We have checked the requirements on the model with the mCRL2 tool set. Because checking of some requirements takes very long, we have not obtained all results yet. The results are:
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
Requirement 1 & true \\
\hline
Requirement 2 & true \\
\hline
Requirement 3 & not yet known \\
\hline
Requirement 4 & not yet known \\
\hline
Requirement 5 & true \\
\hline
Requirement 6 & not yet known \\
\hline
Requirement 7 & true \\
\hline
Requirement 8 & not yet known \\
\hline
Requirement 9 & not yet known \\
\hline
Requirement 10 & true \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

We expect all requirements, except for $3$ to result in $true$. Before the process checking requirement $3$ could finish, we found that it would most likely result in $false$, signaling a fault in our model. The requirement states that all wafers should end up projected in $RO$. Because doors can get stuck, in some cases this is not possible, so the requirement is addapted to make an exception for these situations. First, when both sluices have a malfunctioning door, it is clear that no wafers can be processed anymore. So this was added as an exception. Secondly, since our kept our model simple and only allowed certain moves for $R2$, a projected wafer that is in a sluice with its outside door stuck, $R2$ cannot remove the wafer from that sluice and place it in the other, functioning, sluice. Because of this we added another exception: when a wafer is inside the sluice when one of its doors gets stuck, it is no longer required to end up in $RO$. However, we did not take into account that the system could move a wafer into the sluice \emph{after} the door got stuck. This wafer cannot be recovered in our current model either.

It is probably best to solve this problem by addapting our model, so that $R2$ can move wafers from one sluice to another in order to safe wafers that got stuck in a sluice. This way, no wafer would get lost even if a wafer is inside a sluice while a single door gets stuck. We chose not to addapt our model, since that would leave us with barely enough time to run check $2$ requirement on the new model.
