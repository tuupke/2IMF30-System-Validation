We have checked the requirements on the model with the mCRL2 tool set. Because checking of some requirements takes very long, we have not obtained all results yet. The results are:
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}

Requirement 2 & true \\

Requirement 3 & not yet known \\
\hline
Requirement 4 & not yet known \\

Requirement 6 & not yet known \\
\hline
Requirement 7 & true \\

Requirement 8 & not yet known \\
